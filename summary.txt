Recommender By Joe Franz and Ace Zhang
This project gives a user a profile and provides book recommendations using Apache Mahout. 
A user creates a profile or logs into a previously existing profile. From there the user can add ratings for books
they have read, get an item based recommendation, get a user based recommendation, save their books, and view their books.
The recommender returns 5 books for the user.
