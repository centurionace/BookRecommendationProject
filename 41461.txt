I¡¯m late to the Murakami party, but I¡¯m glad I arrived. People here seem to be enjoying themselves, passing his books around enthusiastically while ordering many rounds of sake and Japanese beer and nibbling on cucumber with nori and soy sauce. I think I¡¯ll stay a while.

This is the first Murakami book that I didn¡¯t quite ¡°get.¡± But I still enjoyed the scenes and concepts and imagery¡­the story just didn¡¯t piece together as well for me as I felt it was supposed to.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is, by any chance, a bad book. My low rating can be easily explained by the fact that I've already read too much Murakami.

I absolutely adore Murakami's way of creating bizarre incidents that aren't necessarily explained or tied together nicely like a typical mystery novel. Mind and reality clash in his works, and Dance, Dance, Dance is one of his most fascinating journeys of this clash.
