What a sweet sensitive book. This is my first by Murakami, but it won't be my last. Highly recommended.

I firmly believe that you don¡¯t choose your books; the books choose you. Yeah, I¡¯m one of them people who think that there is no such thing as a coincidence. So, this SOTBWFTS (short form) was a gift from a friend on my birthday.

This is Murakami's second book. Like its predecessor, this one is also nostalgic, in a whole different way though. I also found it darker and a bit trickier. Like any Murakami, god knows how many symbolisms I didn't get... Say what you will. Murakami is the Man!
